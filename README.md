# Feed Reader Testing

## Project Overview

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. In this project, a web-based application that reads RSS feeds was tested using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). The main aim was to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

## How to run the application

This application can be  cloned from the repository at `git clone https://github.com/merhawi2010/merhawi2010.github.io.git` and save it on hard drive. After downloading the content from the repository you will need to extract the zip-file. By double clicking the index.html file you can run the application and enjoy it.

To run individual tests, please click the links at the bottom part of the page.
